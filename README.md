# Calculator-Using-VanillaJS
Made a calculator using HTML,CSS and Javascript(Vanilla JS).
Mainly did it as a frontend practice.
Used eval() function in JS which kinda defeats the whole calculator logic thingy, but I'll see if it can be improved.

Also, the UI is inspired from freecodecamp.org's calculator project. 
Looks similars, but all the things are done by me.(Nothing is copied except height and width values).
